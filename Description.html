                This program takes a user's inputs through the use of the buttons on screen and allows them to add, 
                subtract, multiply, divide, (and if we have the time to make the function we can add exponents to this 
                sentence) their inputs. The calculator runs off of a combination of HTML plus Javascript/Jquery and is 
                styled with CSS. If you are having trouble getting the calculator to work, please click the 'Help' button 
                to visit the Help page which will detail how the calculator works with an explanation and accompanying 
                videos and screenshots.
            </center>
            </p>
        <p>To use this calculator, press any number you see on the screen as you see fit. Once you have selected your first number(s), pick your operator sign (Plus / "+", Minus / "-", Multiply / "*", Divide / "/", or Exponent / "^"), select your next number(s), and finally hit the equals (=) button to see the end result.</p>
        <p>If you have made a mistake with your equation at any point, just click the "C" button. This will clear your equation and allow you to input it from the very beginning.</p>
        <p>If you are still unsure as to how the program works, please look at the accompanying screenshots and videos that will walk you through the process step-by-step.</p>

        <p>For this example, the screenshots will be showing how to operate the calculator with addition. If you would like to use subtraction, multiplication, or division please substitute the usage of the "+" operator with your desired operator.</p>
