        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Kyle Barker, and I am a junior in the applied computer science program with no concentration after the unfortunate pausing of the gaming concentration until 2022. </br>
            Although I am officially unemployed, I've found my job for the past 6 months to be feeding neighborhood stray cats of which there are around 7.  </br>
            My hobbies are playing video games, listening to music, reading, and watching the weekly episodes of One Piece as they come on Saturday nights at around 10:30 PM.</br>
            With my degree, I hope to pursue a job in the field of animation, but because South Carolina is not the best place for that, I will instead be finding me a job that will carry me over until I can save up enough money to move somewhere better for my dream job.</br>
            Just a few weeks ago, one of the strays turned out to be a mother so now we are taking care of an absolutely adorable, tiny kitten who I have tentatively named Churro.
